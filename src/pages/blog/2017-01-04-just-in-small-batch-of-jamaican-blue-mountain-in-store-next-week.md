Swarukta Charitable Trust in association with Christ University is back with its second edition of women entrepreneurs meet in Bengaluru “Women Entrepreneurs Beyond Boundaries – WEBB 2019” to be held on 23rd-24th September 2019.

This event brings together innovators, investors, motivators and influencers who support female entrepreneurs and help them work towards a successful journey of growth and development.

More than 100 women entrepreneurs, business leaders and venture capitalist from different parts of the country will participate in the event and would highlight on the startup ecosystem, the rise of female participation in the business, and investment opportunities in the sub-continent.

In addition to providing women entrepreneurs with a platform to connect with fellow professionals and expand their local and inter-state network, WEBB 2019 will also allow the female business magnates to attend many informative sessions that will help them deal with everyday challenges faced during business operations.

From the session on various women-centric schemes and government policies to one-on-one mentoring on finance management and customer-relations management, there are many takeaways of the event. In addition, there will be high-on-content seminars as well as speeches by motivational speakers.

Women entrepreneurs from across states can brainstorm, discuss and understand business expansion and start-up ideas and can work as a mentor to each other.

As cultural and political barriers along with restricted access to capital and technology, limit the success of women-owned businesses, WEBB 2019 is aimed at empowering them by giving them a platform to connect and thrive. By hosting this networking event, Swarukta Charitable Trust hopes to foster a positive and accepting ecosystem for women entrepreneurs in Bengaluru and across the country.
