  We at CocoWing are working on the principle of extracting the Best from the Waste. We collect and clean the coconut garbage from nearby areas and make beautiful biodegradable jewellery, Candle Holders and Bowls from it. We are hiring and training underprivileged women to help them earn a living and support their family. Our business has two mottos: Reduce and reuse the coconut garbage and help the underprivileged.
