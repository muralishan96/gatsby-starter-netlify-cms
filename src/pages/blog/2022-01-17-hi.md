Nirupama Chirmade, founder of *Niru's World Of Art*

Home decor and gift articles

![](/img/niru3.jpg)

When my husband want to shift abroad,I choose to quit my career as an Ayurvedic doctor and join him in his pursuits. Quitting what I had studied and practiced all the years was not easy but then I knew I had much more within myself. I am \*Nirupama Chirmade\*,born as an artist and wanted to bring that alive by pursuing it as a hobby.

After learning \*One Stroke Painting\*,I started chasing my dream of becoming an entrepreneur in the world of art.

To begin with I started applying my skills on greeting cards, personalized painting and posters which I gifted them to my friends. Slowly with the word of mouth, my work started getting recognized. After coming back to India, I started my

Face book page, \*Niru's World Of Art\*

I started doing One Stroke painting on wooden boxes, bamboo, canvas, leather, terracotta and many more. With an encouragent from my children, husband and friends I started taking customise orders from friends and small companies.

\*Hand crafted and Hand painted Home decor and gift articles\* are available.

In my small bussiness I save the part of my profit to teach art to under privilege children which help them to increase their focus and concentration in academics and work.

Uptil now my work got recognize by

1. Swakruta - The best entrepreneur award of 2019
2. NID(National Institute of Design)
3. Best product award from forum mall at Christ University.
4. Society development award in Arts, from Anand foundation, Delhi.

Teaching art to more and more children and women through workshops, and giving employment to them is my goal.

I follow other hobbies like gardening, reading, travelling and cooking.

Swakruta is the best platform for networking.Meeting likeminded people in Swakruta help me a lot. In this journey Mrs. Manik Patwardhan is my mentor. I follow her Principles like, always find solution to all problems which we face in the businesses and happily accept the situation.There are many more to learn.
