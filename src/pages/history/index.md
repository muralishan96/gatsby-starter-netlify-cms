Our first Swakruta SEWA program happened at YWCA - Koramangala. With cancer awareness program to 40 ladies of slum dwellers from near by area, Dr Needa Shaheen gave a talk about cervical cancer, itâ€™s early detection and our own member Mrs. Seema Kundalia spoke about breast cancer and how it can be prevented and detected at early stages.

Swakruta is taking one more initiative in reducing the plastic use by distributing cotton/synthetic shopping bags as a token gift to SEWA - service providers when they attend SEWA programs.

Second session of Swakruta SEWA is being happening on WEBB,2019 at Christ University, where workshops on various skills and government schemes would be done.[](http://www.swakruta.in/static/42f86af1e6e6611b05c0c33ff51f2483/07fe7/sewa3.jpg)
